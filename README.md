One More Dot File Repo

This is an attempt at keeping my config files somewhat in sync across the various machines I use them on. 


# Usage

All of the configurations live in the home directory. 
Running the `install.sh` script will create any directories that don't already
exist, and then create symlinks for any file inside of the home directory.
